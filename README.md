      Bugs / Issues
      - Changing Eevee's gender while its wearing a hat can choose the wrong color. Refresh the page and reslect to fix
      - touch screen canvas bug (ugh)
      - May need to double click in order to load the model properly (I dont want there to be a massive delay when clicking)

      Things to Do!
      - There are some color inaccuracies, due to the color files are encrypted. Also the fact i dont have alot of pokemon at max level to color pick.
